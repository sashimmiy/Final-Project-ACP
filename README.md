# *ABOUT THE APPLICATION*

The Local Goods Store App is an application developed using Python aligned in the Sustainable Development Goal No. 8: Decent Work and Econnomic Growth. It is an application that can aid store owners. The application displays all the available items per category and their price per kilogram. 

# *STEP BY STEP ACTION AND PURPOSE OF THE APPLICATION*

Once the user runs the program, a panel will appear showing all the items per category. Their prices are also indicated per kilogram. The user will select the purchased products. The selcted items will appear in the text box, then the program will automatically add up all the selcted items and will display the total amount. Applying discount is also applicable by entering the discount percentage. Clicking on the Checkout button will complete the process. 

# *CLASSES*
1. Product
2. Category
3. Order
4. Application

# *FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM*
* This program is used to calculate the total amount of items purchased
* This program automatically subtract the amount of the entered discount percentage.

# *LIMITATIONS*
* Removing/Deleting a selected item from the order list.
* Accepting payment amount and calculating due change.

# *CONCLUSION*
In conclusion, we are able to create a program incorporating what we have learned from this course such as OOP principles, functions, and data structures and algorithms. Learning new language was a struggle, but it surely contributed to our journey as programmers.
